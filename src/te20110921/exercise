Implement a SyncStrIntMap class in java. It takes a Map <String,Integer> (supposed to be non 
thread safe) at creation time and implements a thread safe version of the map. It provides the 
usual get,put,remove,containsKey and size methods. The first three methods suspend the caller 
if the passed key has not an associated value (methods get and remove) or if it has a already 
one (method put).
